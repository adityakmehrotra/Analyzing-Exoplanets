# Analyzing-Exoplanets
Using ggplot2 in R to Analyze NASA's Exoplanet dataset.

I will observe the answers to the following questions:
- How is the Exoplanet's Mass related to its Radius?
- Which Discovery Method is most common when discovering new Exoplanets?
- How many Exoplanets were Discovered Using each Method?
- What is the Distribution of the Masses of Exoplanets in the dataset?
